# House Price Prediction Model
### This is The 1st Task in The Internship of CodeClause Internship in Artificial Intellagence

#### The task is prediction of house price using Regression Algorithms.

The main process is training the model on the data of house price in KC to make a model can predict any house price based on specific features.
The dataset contains 21 features and +21600 records.

### The model has walk through these steps:
- Importing the necessary libraries ~ (Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn...).
- EDA
- Feature Engineering
- Initialize the model for the training process
- Starting the prediction process.
- Model Evaluating.
- Comparing tThe actual label with the model predicted label.
- Testing the model on new values.

### The Algorithm used in this model is:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

### The choosen Algorithm is Random Forest based on the model performance
